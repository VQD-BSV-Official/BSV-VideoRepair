Recover damaged files, lost source when recording, incomplete by extracting h264. Currently supports: MP4, MOV... <br>
I opened this source later than other sources such as: untrunc, mp4fixer, djifix or recover_mp4. <br>
This open source so I can improve video repair. And learn from the sources

You can buy full source code (GUI & main.py). All code is built-in without missing data. If you can not fix, <br>
please send me a broken file and good sample file (if any), please upload to drive, mega ..etc. <br>
and send the link to my gmail. And if successful, this is not free.


## Usage
To recover, you need:
1. Folder containing damaged files
2. Prepare a place to save the file (empty)
3. Recommended to run on Windows, instead of Linux.
4. Good sample file. The file must be the same device or software. <br>
The same parameters (Resolution, FPS, audio format).

To use:
1. Select the folder containing the video file
2. Click Home => Advanced Repair. If your video is DJI lost power while recording, press DJI Repair
3.
